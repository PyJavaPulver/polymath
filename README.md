# PolyMath
### What is that?
Polymath is a simple two polynomial terminal script calculator written in Python! 

In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients. A polynomial is composed of several monomials. An example of a polynomial is ```x**2 âˆ’ 4*x + 7```.

### Sintax
- To write powers use "**", ex: ```x**7``` (x to the 7). 
- To write multiplications use "*", ex: ```x*5```. 
- To write divisions use "/", ex: ```5*x/x```. 
- To write additions and subtractions use "+" and "-", ex: ```5+x-4```.

### Setup
It's very simple, you just clone this repostory on your computer and run the 'main.py' file in a terminal using Python 3 or higher.

You don't have to install additional modules or components. If the program needs one, it will install it automatically.

To run the script (in the directory where the file is):
    ``` python3 main.py ```
## And, that's all! Enjoy! :)
